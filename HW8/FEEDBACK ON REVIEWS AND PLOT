the reviews were ok but a bit superficial 9/10

NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===================

too many vivid colors are distracting

agegroup one word in the tiel

thousands is not ameaningful axis labels; use "Population (units of 1,000 peope")

and then why use units of 1000 when your first tick label is 1e5? then one has to think what 1e5*1000 is. use units of millions, and then your first tick is 100 etc


NOTES ON YOUR PLOT THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
===========================================


docmarionum1
============



nice visualization

some labels cannot be read (blue on blue)

the animation is jittery on roll over: add a delay to overcome that

the animation is also unnecessary since seecting a bubble does not d anything. teh circle around it would be justified if info appeared, to clarify what the info refers to

the zoom is also unnecessary as it does not reveal any details, just hides the details about the rest of the data



CUSP2015BO
============

good plot, good choice of BW and mean/median in read that highlights it. 

consider using a larger unit on the y axis (miles?)


yuqiaocen
============

the plot is very busy. 

no point in starting at the negative range: remove the <0 space

two legends for the regression lines and the datapoints may be better: clearer less overwhelming

association of color to rage triggers preconceptions. since you have few categories shapes may be a better choice.
